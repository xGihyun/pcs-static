            <p>
              The Science teachers were able to develop their personally
              designed laboratory experiments and activities which they think
              will suit the needs and level of interest of the students. Some of
              these activities are used as motivation for getting the attention
              and interest of the students, especially in opening a new
              topic/concept in Science. Most of these activities/experiments
              make use of familiar or common materials in order for students to
              realize their importance in daily life activities. These also help
              the students be aware of some chemicals inside or outside the
              environment. The experiments are also designed to suggest further
              studies and experiments on similar concepts. Thereby, the
              analytical and scientific thinking skills of the students are
              developed. These could also help them realize the career they may
              want to pursue in the future.
